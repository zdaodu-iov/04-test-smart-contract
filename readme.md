- **MeowToken.sol**: A smart contract for the Meow Token.
- **OneMilNftPixels.sol**: A smart contract for a one million NFT pixels project.
- **PurrToken.sol**: A smart contract for the Purr Token.

## Key Features
- Implementation of various token contracts.
- NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contract with unique features.
- Comprehensive test suites for each contract.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity for smart contract development.
- JavaScript for testing.
- [Additional frameworks/libraries used in the project].
